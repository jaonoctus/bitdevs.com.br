# BitDevs Brasil

An interactive map of Brazilian cities with an active [BitDevs](https://bitdevs.org/about)
group — Socratic seminars where developers gather to discuss changes to the Bitcoin
protocol and the technologies around it.

The map renders a dotted Brazil on a canvas over a dimmed backdrop of its
neighbours, drops a marker on every city, and keeps a searchable city index in
sync with it. All city data comes from a single JSON file, so adding a community
is a one-line change.

## Tech stack

- **[React](https://react.dev/)** + **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**
- **[Vite](https://vite.dev/)** for dev server and bundling
- **[Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/)** for styling (brand tokens in `@theme`)
- **[Bun](https://bun.sh/)** as the package manager and runtime
- **[d3-geo](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo)** (Natural Earth projection) +
  **[topojson-client](https://github.com/topojson/topojson-client)** +
  **[world-atlas](https://github.com/topojson/world-atlas)** for the map

## Getting started

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (>= 1.3). Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

### Scripts

```bash
bun run dev      # start the dev server (http://localhost:5173)
bun run build    # type-check and build for production into dist/
bun run preview  # serve the production build locally
```

## Add your city

There are two ways to get a city onto the map. Pick whichever you are comfortable
with — both end up in the same place.

### Option A — Open an issue (no coding required)

If you don't want to touch the code, just
[open a "New city" issue](https://github.com/jaonoctus/bitdevs.com.br/issues/new?template=add-city.yml)
with your city, country and the group's link. A maintainer will add it for you. If
you don't know the exact coordinates, leave them blank — we'll fill them in.

### Option B — Open a pull request

City data lives in [`src/data/bitdevs.json`](src/data/bitdevs.json). Add an object to
the array and open a PR:

```json
{
  "id": "acre",
  "city": "Acre",
  "country": "Brazil",
  "lat": -9.0238,
  "lng": -70.812,
  "url": "https://bitdevsacre.org/"
}
```

The marker and the city card are generated automatically from each entry — no other
changes are needed.

#### Field reference

| Field     | Type   | Description                                              |
| --------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`      | string | Kebab-case slug of the city; joins the entry to its topics and events. |
| `city`    | string | City name shown on the marker and in the index.          |
| `country` | string | Country, shown as the marker subtitle.                   |
| `lat`     | number | Decimal-degree latitude of the city center.              |
| `lng`     | number | Decimal-degree longitude of the city center.             |
| `url`     | string | Public link to the group (website, Meetup, X or GitHub). |

#### Guidelines

- Keep the list **alphabetical by city** so diffs stay clean.
- Make `id` the kebab-case, unaccented form of the city (`São Paulo` → `sao-paulo`)
  and keep it unique — the topics and events aggregators key off it.
- Use the **city center** coordinates in decimal degrees. You can grab them from
  Google Maps (right-click a location to copy `lat, lng`) or
  [latlong.net](https://www.latlong.net/).
- Make sure the group is **active** and the link works.
- Run `bun run build` before opening the PR to confirm everything still compiles.
